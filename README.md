# Hi, I'm Angelo 👋👨🏻‍💻

I make stuff, mostly with [code][d] or [words][b].

```swift
enum Angelo {
	static let fullName = "Angelo Stavrow"
	static let location = "Montreal, Canada 🇨🇦"
	static let pronouns = "he/him"
}
```

## 🚀 Check out some of my current projects:

- I recently launched [Thought Detox][td], an iPhone app that helps you find peace by writing down negative thoughts and throwing them away.
- I built [a command-line tool][hi] in Go for the [Write.as][wa] team to help you import your Hugo-powered blog.
- I also [built an iOS/macOS client][wfc] for the Write.as team for publishing to your Write.as/WriteFreely blog. Check out the [Swift package][wfp] that wraps the API, too. I've written about some of the process [here][wab]

## ⌛️ Here are some of my past projects:

- My [first iOS app][hj] was a visual future-value calculator, designed to help you understand the real cost of your spending.
- I co-hosted two seasons of the [Make Before Break podcast][mbb]. It's on hiatus right now.
- I built an indieweb-focused Hugo theme called [Indigo][idg].

## 😬 And here are some projects that I need to update:

- My [second iOS app][per] is simple price-per-unit calculator that's designed to help you get the biggest bang for your buck. I've started rewriting it, and I blogged about [the first 50 days][prd] of progress.
- My [personal site][c], whose posts were migrated over to a dedicated [blog][b].
